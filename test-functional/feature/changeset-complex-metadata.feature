Feature: Change Set: Handle Properties of Complex Metadata Types

  Scenario Outline: Child metadata are added and/or updated
    Given a list of "<child>" metadata in "<data>" folder which has been added and updated in a git repository
     When a user launches a change set with force-dev-tool
     Then it will create a change set with the list of "<child>" metadata
      And excluding any "<parent>" metadata in the change set
      And the change set could be deployed correctly

    Examples:
      | parent       | child           | data                                   |
      | CustomObject | CustomField     | complex-metadata/customField-added     |
      | CustomObject | CustomField     | complex-metadata/customField-updated   |
      | CustomObject | RecordType      | complex-metadata/recordType-added      |
      | CustomObject | WebLink         | complex-metadata/weblink-added         |
      | CustomObject | ValidationRule  | complex-metadata/validationRule-added  |
      | CustomObject | FieldSet        | complex-metadata/fieldSet-added        |
      | CustomObject | ListView        | complex-metadata/listView-added        |
      | CustomObject | CompactLayout   | complex-metadata/compactLayout-added   |
      | CustomObject | BusinessProcess | complex-metadata/businessProcess-added |
      | CustomObject | SharingReason   | complex-metadata/sharingReason-added   |
      | CustomObject | QuickAction     | complex-metadata/quickAction-updated   |

  Scenario Outline: Child metadata are removed
    Given a list of "<child>" metadata in "<data>" folder which has been removed in a git repository
     When a user launches a change set with force-dev-tool
     Then it will create a destructive change with the list of "<child>" metadata
      And excluding any "<parent>" metadata in the change set
      And the change set could be deployed correctly

    Examples:
      | parent       | child           | data                                     |
      | CustomObject | CustomField     | complex-metadata/customField-removed     |
      | CustomObject | WebLink         | complex-metadata/weblink-removed         |
      | CustomObject | ValidationRule  | complex-metadata/validationRule-removed  |
      | CustomObject | FieldSet        | complex-metadata/fieldSet-removed        |
      | CustomObject | ListView        | complex-metadata/listView-removed        |
      | CustomObject | CompactLayout   | complex-metadata/compactLayout-removed   |
      | CustomObject | BusinessProcess | complex-metadata/businessProcess-removed |
      | CustomObject | SharingReason   | complex-metadata/sharingReason-removed   |

  Scenario Outline: Parent metadata are added, updated and/or removed
    Given a list of "<parent>" metadata in "<data>" folder which has been changed in a git repository
     When a user launches a change set with force-dev-tool
     Then it will create a change set with all "<parent>" metadata
      And excluding any "<child>" metadata in the change set
      And the change set could be deployed correctly

    Examples:
      | parent       | child         | data                                          |
      | CustomObject | CustomField   | complex-metadata/label-updated                |
      | CustomObject | CustomField   | complex-metadata/pluralLabel-updated          |
      | CustomObject | SearchLayouts | complex-metadata/searchLayout-account-changed |
      | CustomObject | SearchLayouts | complex-metadata/searchLayout-custom-added    |

  Scenario Outline: Parent & child metadata are changed
    Given a list of "<parent & child>" metadata in "<data>" folder which has been changed in a git repository
     When a user launches a change set with force-dev-tool
     Then it will create a change set with all "<parent & child>" metadata
      And the change set could be deployed correctly

    Examples:
      | parent & child       | data                                            |
      | CustomObject         | complex-metadata/label-and-customField-updated  |

  Scenario Outline: Parent are changed & child metadata are removed
    Given a list of "<parent & child>" metadata in "<data>" folder which has been changed in a git repository
     When a user launches a change set with force-dev-tool
     Then it will create a change set with all "<parent & child>" metadata
      And it will create a destructive change with the list of "<child>" metadata
      And excluding any "<child>" metadata in the change set
      And the change set could be deployed correctly

    Examples:
      | parent & child       | child       | data                                                    |
      | CustomObject         | CustomField | complex-metadata/label-updated-and-customField-removed  |
